Anomaly detection using Machine Learning approaches


Anomaly detection, outlier detection or fraud investigation is a technique used to identify abnormal patterns that do not conform to expected behaviour.
In this project, I would like to simulate a basic anomaly detection model using Machine Learning approaches.

Note: deep learning and neural networks and autoencoders are still count as a  machine learning technique when they are using diversion instead of regression!
